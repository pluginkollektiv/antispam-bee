## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Does Antispam Bee prevents spam registrations or protects form plugins? ###
Antispam Bee works best with default WordPress comments. It does not help to protect form plugins and does not prevent spam registrations. Hopefully we can provide better hooks for third party plugins to use Antispam Bee to fill this gap in the forthcoming new major version.

### Does Antispam Bee work with Jetpack, wpDiscuz, Disqus Comments and similar comment plugins?
Antispam Bee works best with default WordPress comments. It is not compatible with Jetpack, wpDiscuz or Disqus Comments as those plugins load a new comment form within an iframe. Thus Antispam Bee can not access the comment form directly.

### Does Antispam Bee work with AJAX comment plugins or similar theme features?
Whether Antispam Bee works with a comment form submitted via AJAX depends on how the AJAX request is made. If the request goes to the file that usually also receives the comments, Antispam Bee could work with it out of the box (the [WP Ajaxify Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-ajaxify-comments/) plugin does this, for example). 

If the comments are sent to the `admin-ajax.php`, the `antispam_bee_disallow_ajax_calls` filter must be used to run ASB for requests to that file as well. If the script does not send all form data to the file, but only some selected ones, further customization is probably necessary, as [exemplified in this post by Torsten Landsiedel](https://torstenlandsiedel.de/2020/10/04/ajaxifizierte-kommentare-und-antispam-bee/) (in German).

### Does Antispam Bee store any private user data, and is it compliant with GDPR? ###
Antispam Bee is developed in Europe. You might have heard we can be a bit nitpicky over here when it comes to privacy. The plugin does not save private user data and is 100% compliant with GDPR.

### Will I have to edit any theme templates to get Antispam Bee to work? ###
No, the plugin works as is. You may want to configure your favorite settings, though.

### Does Antispam Bee work with shortened IPs? ###
Generally yes. However, commissioning the Antispam Bee plugin for canceled or shortened IP addresses in comment metadata is not recommended. Because the name and the e-mail address of the comments are not unique, an IP address is the only reliable measure. The more complete the stored IP addresses, the more reliable the assignment or detection of spam.

### How can I submit undetected spam? ###
If the antispam plugin has passed some spam comments, these comments can be reported for analysis. A [Google table](http://goo.gl/forms/ITzVHXkLVL) was created for this purpose.

### Antispam Bee with Varnish? ###
If WordPress is operated with Apache + Varnish, the actual IP address of the visitors does not appear in WordPress. Accordingly the Antispam-Plugin lacks the base for the correct functionality. An adaptation in the Varnish configuration file /etc/varnish/default.vcl provides a remedy and forwards the original (not from Apache) IP address in the HTTP header X-Forwarded-For:

> if (req.restarts == 0) {
>     set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = client.ip;
> }

### Are there some paid services or limitations? ###
No, Antispam Bee is free forever, for both private and commercial projects. You can use it on as many sites as you want. There is no limitation to the number of sites you use the plugin on.
